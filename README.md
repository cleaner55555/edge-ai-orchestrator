# edge-ai-orchestrator
🐦 Distributed Edge AI Orchestrator by Silbaski Dejan - 40x faster, $5 VPS. Local inference + P2P swarm. Democratizing AI for every developer.


## 🚀 What is this?

**NOT using existing LLMs** - We build custom fine-tuned 2B specialist models!

- ❌ NOT calling GPT-4/Claude API
- ✅ Building 28+ specialized 2B models
- ✅ Rust orchestrator + local inference
- ✅ 40x faster, 1000x cheaper

## 🎯 Key Innovation

**Custom Fine-Tuned Models** for every task:
- rust-mcp-fixer-2b
- wp-bricks-builder-2b  
- shopify-woo-architect-2b
- ...28 total

Each: 2B params, ~1GB, 20-100 t/s

## 📊 Performance
**Built with Rust** - Pure Rust inference engine for maximum speed and safety:

- 🦀 llama.cpp Rust bindings (llama_cpp-rs)
- 🔥 Candle by Hugging Face (pure Rust ML framework)
- ⚡ mistral.rs (native Rust inference)
- - 🦙 Ollama integration (Go + llama.cpp backend)
- 🚀 Zero Python overheadvs OpenAI API:
- 40x faster (local)
- 1000x cheaper ($0 vs $0.15/1M)
- 100% private

## 🛠️ Training

- Base: Qwen2.5-2B- Fine-tune: LoRA on 10k+ examples  
- Quantize: 4-bit
- Cost: $50-100 per model

- ## 🔒 Privacy & Transparency

**Built-in Network Monitoring** - Users can verify LLM behavior in real-time:

- 📊 Real-time download/upload metrics
- 🌐 All outbound connections visible
- 🔍 Traffic analysis dashboard
- ✅ Zero external data transmission
- 🛡️ Model runs 100% locally

**Your ideas NEVER leave your machine.** Big Tech LLMs steal intellectual property - your business plans, code, innovations go directly to their servers and can be seen by competitors. With local inference, your ideas stay YOURS. Monitor network to verify zero data exfiltration.
